#Dyslexia Prediction System (ML Project)

A web-based machine learning application that predicts the likelihood of dyslexia using behavioral task data such as clicks, hits, misses, accuracy, and scores. The system supports early screening of learning difficulties by analyzing cognitive performance across tasks.
