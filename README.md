# Dyslexia Prediction System (ML Project)

A web-based machine learning application that predicts the likelihood of dyslexia using behavioral task data such as clicks, hits, misses, accuracy, and scores.  
This system supports early screening of learning difficulties by analyzing cognitive performance across multiple tasks.

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- Scikit-learn  
- Streamlit (Interactive UI)

## Highlights
- Trained and compared multiple machine learning models:
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Logistic Regression
- Deployed the best-performing model for prediction
- Performed data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation
- Provides real-time predictions through a clean and user-friendly interface
- Optimized user inputs using dropdowns, radio buttons, and visual feedback
